  * North East: The North East region had the highest revenue in both 2014 and 2015 but there was a huge drop in sales in 2015. The drop in sales may be due to increased competition in the market.
  * South West: This region generated the 2nd highest revenue in 2014 and 2015 but Shows a huge decrease in revenue in 2015. The decline in sales may indicate a rising competitor in the market andthe prices of the products were seen to be high.
 * South South, South East and North West: There was a slight decrease of revenue generated in 2015 in all three regions indicating a potential area of concern due to price strategies implemented.
